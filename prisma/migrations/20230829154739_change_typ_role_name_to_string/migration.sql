  Warnings:

  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[name]` on the table `Role` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
  - Changed the type of `name` on the `Role` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
